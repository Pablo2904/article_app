Ok, so app works fine and has all funcionalities from assigment task, also its not hight that actual (2020) ECMa version.
Elements ale placed accordingly to wireframes, for styling I used boostrap and just a few lines of CSS, located in simple .css file in style folder.
App keeps behavior accordingly to describe - fetch single categroy when single checkbox is checked, and fetch all if non of them are checked.
I was trying to not add to much libraries according to task desc.
I didint use any state Mamnager or Context API because app isnt very "nested" and I didint notice prop drilling.
