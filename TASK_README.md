Ok, so app works fine and has all funcionalities from assigment task, also its not hight that actual (2020) ECMa version.
Elements ale placed accordingly to wireframes, for styling I used boostrap and just a few lines of CSS, located in simple .css file in style folder.
App keeps behavior accordingly to describe - fetch single categroy when single checkbox is checked, and fetch all if non of them are checked.
I was trying to not add to much libraries according to task desc.
I didint use any state Mamnager or Context API because app isnt very "nested" and I didint notice prop drilling.

About improvments webpack version could be upgraded to newer version (5.x.x). Good idea also would be to get Date from a server in some proper format.
As the application grows its good idea to implement TS, and with styles file grows SASS.
Aa well best idea would be to add at last some smoke tests and few e2e.
